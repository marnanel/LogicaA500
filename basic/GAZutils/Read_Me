Gazetteer names files on this disc
----------------------------------

There are two files of Gazetteer names on this floppy;

Gaznames1 - A list of all gazetteer names, by areal unit,
            with area names which reference invalid MapData
            records 'hidden'. This is the same as the names
            displayed by the DataMerge package. 
            
            E.g. for ITV region n/o 2, the names are:

                 2      Central
                 4      Scottish TV
                 9      South West TV
                11      Tyne Tees


Gaznames2 - A complete list of all possible names, regardless
            of whether they reference a valid MapData record.

            E.g. for ITV region n/o 2, the names are:   

                 1      Grampian
                 2      Central
                 3      Border
                 4      Scottish TV
                 5      Channel
                 6      Thames/LWT
                 7      Granada
                 8      Anglia
                 9      South West TV
                10      TVS
                11      Tyne Tees
                12      Ulster
                13      Harlech (Cymru)
                14      Yorkshire
                15      Harlech (West of England)


In addition, there is a file called Difference, which lists the 
differences between the two names files. This is the output of the
Compare utility on the A500.

I have looked at the original file of Gazetteer names on the floppy
given to Stewart Atkins last Friday, and for some as yet undiscovered
reason there ARE a few names missing. I believe that the files on this
floppy are the complete versions. Many apologies for the trouble 
caused by the first erroneous file.
