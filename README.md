This is the contents of the hard disk of an Archimedes A500 belonging to Logica
in the 1980s. It's a copy of `LogicaA500 Host FS zip` on
[the Domesday86 site](https://www.domesday86.com/?page_id=936).
The extraction was done by Ian Stocks. Major kudos.

Where you have two subdirectories `B` and `C`, `B` will contain BCPL source
and `C` will contain the compiled images of that source.
